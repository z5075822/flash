# Flash
This app was designed to assist students in their learning and understanding of INFS3634 Business Process Management. It includes two self-test features (1) a multiple choice quiz and (2) flashcards to assist with the learning of content. Not only this, but test results are able to be sent to the email used in the initial sign up, linking to the solution sheet for further study. The application caters for those who may struggle with English as a second language by providing a translate function supporting Chinese as well as a speech function allowing for easy word search.
